Machine Learning Basics – Supervised Learning Benefits
=====================================================

Section 1: Accuracy with Guidance
---------------------------------
Supervised learning leverages labeled datasets so models can compare predictions against known answers during training. This guidance usually leads to faster convergence and higher accuracy than unsupervised techniques.

Section 2: Auditability and Compliance
--------------------------------------
Because each training example has a label, organizations can trace why a prediction was made. This transparency supports audits and regulatory reviews.

Section 3: Predictable Performance
----------------------------------
When new production data is similar to the labeled training distribution, supervised models tend to behave predictably, reducing operational surprises.

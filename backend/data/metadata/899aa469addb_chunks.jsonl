This guidance usually leads to faster convergence and higher accuracy than unsupervised techniques.", "section": null, "page_number": null, "chunk_index": 0, "token_count": 42, "metadata": {"source": "data/uploads/ml_benefits.txt", "source_name": "ml_benefits.txt"}}

This transparency supports audits and regulatory reviews.\n\nSection 3: Predictable Performance\n----------------------------------\nWhen new production data is similar to the labeled training distribution, supervised models tend to behave predictably, reducing operational surprises.", "section": null, "page_number": null, "chunk_index": 1, "token_count": 53, "metadata": {"source": "data/uploads/ml_benefits.txt", "source_name": "ml_benefits.txt"}}
